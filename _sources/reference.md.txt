# Extras

## Security & Privacy

VA Explorer uses open-source third-party libraries from well-known and/or reputable sources. The MITRE
Corporation does not vet the security of those software libraries. If security concerns you, you or
your organization may want to review the third-party libraries and their source code on GitHub.

## Attribution

This project relies on contributions from the community, in addition to other existing VA open-source
libraries, without which VA Explorer would not be possible. Portions of this code, therefore, are
copyright the respective developers, which include, but may not be limited to, teams from the CDC
Foundation (e.g., DHIS-2 export) and The Ohio State University (e.g., InterVA5, pyCrossVA, openVA pipeline).
