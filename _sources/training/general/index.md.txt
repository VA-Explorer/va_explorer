# General Information

Welcome to VA Explorer, the open-source application that helps you or your
organization manage and analyze verbal autopsies. This section will help you, as
an end user, become familiar with VA Explorer through three simple steps.

1. **Navigate to your VA Explorer instance**\
  Where did you or your admin setup VA Explorer on the web? Go there in your
  browser and sign in or request an account from your admin as needed.
1. **Explore features based on your role**\
  Read through our [Features](../../usage/features) section to get an idea what
  VA Explorer offers. You should have a role from when you created your account
  or from when one was created for you. See the [User Guides](../user_guides)
  here for role-specific guidance.
1. **Practice taking supported actions**\
  Whatever your role, you have the power to take action in VA Explorer! Try some
  of the actions out as you learn about them in this training, and you will
  build a solid foundation for working with {term}`VA`s in VA Explorer going forward.

Outside of these three steps (which reference this training), modules are
organized into general guidance, role-specific user guides, admin guides, {term}`IT`
guides, and finally, frequently asked questions. Please feel free to submit
feedback if you find anything missing after reading and know that the VA Explorer
team wishes you all the best in your {term}`VA` management experience!

## The VA Questionnaire

VA Explorer’s foundation centers around the management of Verbal Autopsies ({term}`VA`s)
which are conducted by people and organizations around the world according to the
2016 World Health Organization ({term}`WHO`) verbal autopsy instrument. VA Explorer will
support the 2022 {term}`WHO` verbal autopsy instrument in the future, when the {term}`CCVA`
algorithms also support the 2022 questionnaire. Use of non-standard {term}`VA`
instruments may cause issues in VA Explorer if attempted.

## Your VA Explorer Account

An administrator creates Accounts in VA Explorer. Your account role and any
additional settings like geographic restrictions determine the parts of the VA
Explorer you can access and the actions you can take. If you are an admin, this
training covers this workflow.

If you are not an admin and you think your permissions are misconfigured,
contact your system’s admin.
