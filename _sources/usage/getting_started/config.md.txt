# Configuration & Deployment

VA Explorer configuration is primarily set by `docker-compose.yml` with sensible
defaults. Admins or IT Staff with access to the server hosting a VA Explorer
instance can change this configuration via the `.env` file. To begin using this
file (if you haven’t already during Installation & Setup’s Step 4) you can use
`mv .env.template .env` and `vim .env` to open a `.env` file for editing. To
give an idea for how the VA Explorer could be changed each of the options is
documented below.

  * - Variable Name
    - Default Value
    - Description

  * - ``DJANGO_DEBUG``
    - Not Set
    - ``True`` or ``False``. Will configure VA Explorer to report additional
      info in logs, error pages, console messages, and via a debug toolbar if
      ``True``. Not set by default to allow settings.local or
      settings.production to handle value.

  * - ``EMAIL_URL``
    - ``consolemail://``
    - A `Django Environ <https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#environ-env-email-url>`_
      ``email_url`` which supports various email related URL schemas. Used to
      allow VA Explorer to connect to an email server and send email on your
      behalf. Setup to print to the console (docker logs) by default.
      **Recommended to customize.**

  * - ``DJANGO_DEFAULT
      _FROM_EMAIL``
    - ``VA Explorer <noreply@vaexplorer.org>``
    - The email address used in the sender field when VA Explorer sends
      automated emails. Format options include ``Name <email>`` or ``email``.
      Default is app value here instead of
      `Django default <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/settings/#std-setting-DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL>`_.
      **Recommended to customize.**

  * - ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``
    - ``dcc02e52ccbb649b9feb
      e9182abfa5e03c49be6c``
    - Hash `used by Django to cryptographically sign <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/signing/>`_
      things like sessions and account recovery email urls. Defaults to the
      given hard-coded random hash. **Recommended to customize.**

  * - ``DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS``
    - ``localhost``
    - A list of comma separated ``ip:port`` or ``unix:path`` formatted strings
      representing the host's or domain names that VA Explorer can serve. A
      security measure to prevent Host header attacks. Defaults to local
      computer browser only. **Recommended to customize**.

  * - ``CELERY_BROKER_URL``
    - ``redis://redis:6379/0``
    - A `Celery supported backend <https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/backends-and-brokers/index.html>`_
      URL schema. Allows VA Explorer to support reading results from
      long-running tasks such as batch cause-of-death assignment. Points to
      built-in redis service by default.

  * - ``REDIS_URL``
    - ``redis://redis:6379/0``
    - ``ip`` ``port`` or ``unix:path`` format location for
      `Django caching solution <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/cache/>`_.
      Default allows VA Explorer to take advantage of same redis
      available as celery backend so is often the same value.

Config values are read from `.env` first, then `docker-compose.yml` if unset,
and finally from framework settings in `config/settings/production.py` during
end-user docker builds when config hasn't been set elsewhere.

```{note}
If you update any of these configuration variables, please also run
`docker-compose up -d` once more to push your `.env` file updates to the various
containers.
```

For further configuration information, particularly for integrating with
external services such as ODK and DHIS, please see Integrations (link).
