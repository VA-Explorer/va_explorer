# The Admin Role

## User Admin

As admin, you can create and manage user accounts. Each of these accounts will
have a role as described in [User Roles and Capabilities](user_guides). Additionally,
there are workflows available to you as an admin to affect users as a group or
as individuals described below.

### Loading Locations for Geographic Access Support

To set up VA Explorer for the Geographic Access mentioned in that section, you
must load location data into the system.

Locations in VA Explorer follow an assumed three-level hierarchical structure by which each facility or hospital maps to an associated Level 2 ("District") and Level 1 ("Province) hierarchy. Each facility also has a corresponding `key`, which represents the XML option used in the dropdown list within ODK or Kobo, and a `status` which indicates if the Facility is actively producing VAs or not. 

The table below shows an example location hierarchy for States, Counties, and
Cities in the United States. In this example, we have one state (California), two
counties (Marin and Los Angeles), and three cities (Sausalito, San Rafael, and
Los Angeles).

```{csv-table} An example geographic hierarchy in tabular format
:header-rows: 1
Province,District,Name,Key,Status
California,Marin County,Sausalito Hospital, sausalito_hospital, Active
California,Marin County,San Rafael Clinic, san_rafael_clinic, Inactive
California,Los Angeles County,Los Angeles Hospital, los_angeles_hospital, Active
```

The input is similarly structured to support any number of geographic hierarchies
for VA Explorer users. With a {term}`CSV` file in hand, you can now supplement your initial
system set up with the `load_locations` management command. Full usage details
for this are provided in [Management Commands](#management-commands). The specification of the input CSV file is as follows:

```{csv-table} Expected columns for the location file
:header-rows: 1
Column Name, Description, Specifics
Province, Level 1 Administrative Boundary Name, One of the `label::English` values as defined in the VA XLSForm
District, Level 2 Administrative Boundary Name, One of the `label::English` values as defined in the VA XLSForm
Name, Facility or Hospital Name, One of the `label::English` values as defined in the VA XLSForm
Key, Facility or Hospital XML Value, The choice name associated with the `label::English` defined in the previous column
Status, Whether the facility is still actively producing VAs, One of: 'Active' or 'Inactive'
```

Following this command, VA Explorer should support geographic restrictions to any
area or facility you’ve provide, making them available during user creation and
editing. Note that access to geographies higher up in the given tree equates to
access for that geographic area as well as all its children-geographies. For
example, in the above tree a user with access to California also has access to
Marin County, Los Angeles County, Sausalito, San Rafael, and Los Angeles.

#### Updating locations in VA Explorer

When VAs are imported into VA Explorer, they are matched exactly on the locations loaded into the system in this step. If a VA does not have a valid location field, VA Explorer will track that mismatch as an error that either needs to be corrected in the VA Explorer locations file or in the underlying VA data. To add a location to VA Explorer, re-upload a revised location file following the `load_locations` management command.  If a row is deleted from the locations file, it will also be kept in VA Explorer and marked inactive.  To permanently delete locations in VA Explorer, re-upload a revised location file following the `load_locations` management command with the `--delete_previous` flag. Warning: doing so may delete all VAs in the database, so make sure to backup the system first.

### Creating & Editing Users

Click "Users" in the navigation bar to visit the Users page. Click the "Create
User" button to access the user creation form. Alternatively, click the "Edit"
button in the table row for the user you would like to edit. Required fields are
marked with an asterisk(*). To fill in the form:

1. Enter the user’s name

1. Enter the user’s email address. An email address can be used in the system once

1. Choose the user’s role from the dropdown menu

1. Check "Can View PII" if the user is allowed to view {term}`PII` in the system. Also
check "Can Download Data" if the should be allowed to export {term}`VA` data from the
system. See [Abilities to Download and View PII Data](general/roles.md#abilities-to-download-and-view-pii-data)
for details on these permissions if needed

1. Select the geographic region(s), facility, facilities this user can access.
Users with a Field Worker role must be assigned to at least one facility

Click "Create" to create the user or "Update" if editing a user. "Cancel" will
take you back to the Users page without completing the action.

When the "Create" button is clicked during the "Create" process or the "Update"
button is clicked during the "Edit" process, VA Explorer validates the information
you have entered. If there are errors associated with the provided data, VA
Explorer will not create or update the user and the system will show error messages
in red underneath the fields that require correction. Follow instructions to
correct these errors and complete the user creation or edit process if needed.

### Deactivating Users

User accounts are deactivated rather than deleted from VA Explorer. When a user
account is deactivated, they will no longer be able to sign into the system.
Their associated data, however, will still be visible. To deactivate a user,
click "Users" in the navigation bar to visit the Users page. Click the "Edit"
button in the table row for the user you would like to deactivate. Uncheck the
"Active" checkbox. Click "Update." The user will now be deactivated.

### Bulk Creating Users

If you would like to create multiple users at once, particularly during initial
system set up, VA Explorer provides that functionality as a management command.
Please refer to [Management Commands](#management-commands) for details on running
`get_user_form_template` and `bulk_load_users` to obtain a bulk user creation
template and to create your set of users based on that input file.

## Data Admin

As admin, you have full access to all data-related actions. Each step of the
process, from import to editing, to export has workflows available to you as an
admin to affect it as needed.

### Manually Importing Data

If you would like to manually import data from file, (perhaps if troubleshooting
the automatic import process) VA Explorer supports this through the `load_va_csv`
management command. Please refer to [Management Commands](#management-commands)
for details on usage.

Similarly, if you have configured VA Explorer to integrate with {term}`ODK` and would
like to manually import data from {term}`ODK`, VA Explorer also supports this. Use
`import_from_odk` similarly detailed in [Management Commands](#management-commands)

### Manually Running Coding Algorithms

VA Explorer currently supports the InterVA5 coding algorithm and its associated
settings to assign cause of death ({term}`COD`) and may support other coding algorithms
in the future such as InSilicoVA. The InterVA5 coding algorithm depends on the
docker services as described in [Algorithm Support](../usage/integrations.md#algorithm-support)

To run InterVA5 manually, use `run_coding_algorithms` or see the entry for it in
[Management Commands](#management-commands) for full usage details. After the
command has finished execution, a brief report of results should be printed to
console used to run the management command (ex. Coded 24 verbal autopsies
(out of 30) [6 issues]) or an error message if pyCrossVA or InterVA5 are somehow
unavailable; if that is the case, please refer to the
[Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting) section.

## Management Commands

Beyond actions supported by the VA Explorer interface, there are a series of
management commands available exclusively to developers, admins, and {term}`IT` staff
helping to maintain the service. To take advantage of these special commands,
admins and {term}`IT` staff need to, from the server hosting the VA Explorer instance,
enter VA Explorer’s main Django container like so
`docker exec -it va_explorer_django_1 bash`. From there `manage.py` is available
for calling the following commands via:

```shell
manage.py <command> --<parameter_name>=<parameter_input>
```

from within the container. Below is a selection of management commands,
generally useful to admins. An even fuller list of these can be found under
[Development Commands](../develop.md#development-commands)

  * - :rspan:`1` ``load_va_csv``
    - ``--csv_file`` ``(*)``
    - :rspan:`1` Used to manually import data from file to into VA Explorer’s
      database. ``csv_file`` is a filename in the local folder or ``unix:path``
      format location of the file. Can be used with ``random_locations`` for
      test or demo data to randomly assign the VA to a field worker with
      specific location restrictions. ``True`` or ``False``; defaults to
      ``False``

  * - ``--random_locations``

  * - :rspan:`1` ``load_locations``
    - ``--csv_file`` (*)
    - :rspan:`1` Used to load initial location data needed to support
      Geographic access. ``csv_file`` is a filename in the local folder or
      ``unix:path`` format location of the file. Can be used with
      ``delete_previous`` to delete existing location data and start fresh with
      the new locations being loaded. ``True`` or ``False``; defaults to
      ``False``

  * - ``--delete_previous``

  * - :rspan:`1` ``refresh_locations``
    - :rspan:`1` Used to refresh the locations assigned to all of the VAs in
      the database if a new location file is loaded into the system using the
      ``load_locations`` management command. This command does not add or 
      delete any VAs from the database; it simply remaps the existing VAs
      to the new locations.

  * - :rspan:`1` ``export_locations``
    - ``--output_file``
    - :rspan:`1` Utility to obtainthe current list of locations in the VA
      Explorer system in the CSV format with header fields
      corresponding to fields expected by the system. The intended use case
      for this utility is when administrators need to update the location file
      by first downloading the existing locations, making any necessary updates,
      and re-uploading a revised version using ``load_locations``. ``output_file``
      is a filename or ``unix:path`` format location to save template to. Default is
      ``locations_[[date]].csv`` where [[date]] is the date and time of export.


  * - :rspan:`1` ``run_coding_algorithms``
    - ``--overwrite``
    - :rspan:`1` Used to call supported algorithms for assignment of cause of
      death to all uncoded verbal autopsies. ``overwrite`` allows this command
      to clear (and save) all existing CoD assignments before running on
      every verbal autopsy regardless of whether it's coded or not. ``True`` or
      ``False``; defaults to ``False`` ``cod_fname`` is a filename or unix:path
      format location to save the old CoDs to. Defaults to ``old_cod_mapping.csv``

  * - ``--cod_fname``

  * - ``get_user_form
      _template``
    - ``--output_file``
    - Utility to obtain a bulk user creation template csv with header fields
      corresponding to fields of the current User model. ``output_file`` is a
      filename or ``unix:path`` format location to save template to. Default is
      ``user_form_fields.csv``

  * - :rspan:`1` ``bulk_load_users``
    - ``--user_list_file`` ``(*)``
    - :rspan:`1` Used to bulk create user accounts, assigning a temporary
      password to each. ``user_list_file`` is a filename in the local folder or
      ``unix:path`` format location of the users file. Can be used with
      ``email_confirmation`` if an email server has been setup to automatically
      send an email with the new temporary password to each created user.
      ``True`` or ``False``; defaults to ``False`` (prints to console instead so
      passwords must manually be passed to users somehow)

  * - ``--email_confirmation``

      system along with their roles and permissions. Useful for non-invasively
      correlating user activity in VA Explorer logs. ``output_file`` is a
      filename in the local folder or ``unix:path`` format location of the file
      to export user info to. Defaults to ``user_list.csv``. ``user_file`` is a
      separate filename in the local folder or ``unix:path`` format location of
      a ``.txt`` file containing emails (one per line) of specific users to
      export. Defaults to all users if no file.

  * - ``--user_file``

  * - ``mark_vas_as
      _duplicate``
    - None
    - Used to manually run (or re-run if config is changed) duplicate checking
      within VA Explorer. Contains no parameters as behavior is determined by
      the configuration variable ``QUESTIONS_TO_AUTODETECT_DUPLICATES`` see
      :ref:`Configuration & Deployment`
