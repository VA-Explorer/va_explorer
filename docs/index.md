Verbal autopsies (VAs) are a World Health Organization (WHO) -standardized tool
for conducting structured interviews to determine an individual's most likely
cause of death (CoD). VAs use information from next of kin, or witnesses,
regarding symptoms and health history of the deceased prior to their death.

VA Explorer is an open-source web application built to help individuals and
organizations support the management, analysis, and dissemination of VAs. VA
Explorer aims to support integration with existing civil registration and
vital statistics (CRVS) systems at scale while simplifying the use of VAs for
those individuals and organizations.

This documentation aims to be a universal reference for everything related to
VA Explorer. For example:

- If you are interested in using VA Explorer immediately, Getting Started (link)
walks users through installing and running the service.

- For evaluating whether VA Explorer meets your or your organizationâ€™s needs,
more information on supported features can be found in Features (link) while
more info on the CRVS systems VA Explorer works with can be found in Integrations (link)

- Those running an instance of VA Explorer already who would like to become more
familiar with what they can do in their system role as an Admin, Data Manager,
Data Viewer, or Field Worker can do so in User Training (link)

- Users wishing to report bugs, request features, or developers wishing to
contribute to the VA Explorer effort can find resources in Development (link)
